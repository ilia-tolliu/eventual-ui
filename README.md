# Eventual UI update for an event-sourced system

This is the example code to the LinkedIn article.

## Getting started

It is convenient to run backend and frontend in separate terminal tabs.

Run backend on port 8080:

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Run frontend on port 3000:

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Play with it

* Navigate to the frontend: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
* Do stuff with the demo account.
* Enjoy!
