# Eventual UI update for an event-sourced system

This is the example code to the [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7333578021829820418/).

The UI is built with Vite, React and TanStack Query library react-query.

Provided approach is applicable to Vue, Angular, Solid and Svelte as well, since there are corresponding TanStack Query implementations. Check it at the [official TanStack Query page](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

## Getting started

It is convenient to run backend and frontend in separate terminal tabs.

Run backend on port 8080:

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Run frontend on port 3000:

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Play with it

* Navigate to the frontend: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
* Do stuff with the demo account.
* Enjoy!
